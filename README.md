# House Price Prediction (Beginner Machine Learning Project)

## Project Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, quality, and year built.

The goal of this project is to understand the **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, including:
- Loading and exploring data
- Cleaning and preprocessing data
- Building a simple predictive model
- Evaluating model performance

This project uses the **Kaggle House Prices dataset**.
